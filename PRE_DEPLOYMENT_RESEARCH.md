# üîç PRE-DEPLOYMENT RESEARCH: Critical Bitcoin Address Questions

**STOP!** Before deploying the royalty system, we must answer these critical questions about how alkanes handles Bitcoin payments.

## ‚ùì **Critical Questions to Research**

### **Question 1: Bitcoin Address Payments**
- ‚ùì Can alkanes send BTC directly to Bitcoin addresses (e.g., `bc1q...`)?
- ‚ùì Or can alkanes only send to other alkanes (`AlkaneId`)?
- ‚ùì Does `CallResponse` support external Bitcoin outputs?

### **Question 2: Multi-Token Payment System**
```rust
const FRBTC_TOKEN_ID: AlkaneId = AlkaneId { block: 0, tx: 0 };  // Wrapped Bitcoin
const BUSD_TOKEN_ID: AlkaneId = AlkaneId { block: 0, tx: 0 };   // Stablecoin
```
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: These are **alkane-wrapped tokens**, not native Bitcoin
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: Payments stay within alkanes ecosystem only
- ‚úÖ **BENEFIT**: Multi-token support allows flexible payment options

### **Question 3: PSBT Compatibility**
- ‚ùì When someone trades NFTs via PSBT, where can royalties be sent?
- ‚ùì Can royalties be included as Bitcoin outputs in the PSBT?
- ‚ùì Or must royalties be handled separately within alkanes?

## üß™ **Research Methods**

### **Method 1: Alkanes Documentation Review**
- [x] ‚úÖ Check alkanes-rs documentation for Bitcoin address support
- [x] ‚úÖ Look for examples of sending to external addresses
- [x] ‚úÖ Review `CallResponse` structure for Bitcoin outputs

### **Method 2: Code Analysis**
- [x] ‚úÖ Examine alkanes runtime for external payment methods
- [x] ‚úÖ Check if `AlkaneTransfer` supports Bitcoin addresses
- [x] ‚úÖ Look for Bitcoin address validation in alkanes code

### **Method 3: Community Research**
- [ ] Ask in alkanes Discord/community channels
- [ ] Check existing alkanes projects for Bitcoin address usage
- [ ] Contact alkanes developers directly

### **Method 4: Simple Test Contract**
Create a minimal test to answer the core question:

```rust
// Test contract: Can we send BTC to a Bitcoin address?
fn test_bitcoin_address_payment(&self) -> Result<CallResponse> {
    let context = self.context()?;
    let mut response = CallResponse::forward(&context.incoming_alkanes);
    
    // Can we do something like this?
    response.bitcoin_outputs.push(BitcoinOutput {
        address: "bc1qtest...", // Regular Bitcoin address
        amount: 1000, // 1000 sats
    });
    
    // Or are we limited to this?
    response.alkanes.0.push(AlkaneTransfer {
        id: AlkaneId { block: 2, tx: 123 }, // Only alkane IDs
        value: 1000,
    });
    
    Ok(response)
}
```

## üéØ **Decision Tree Based on Research Results**

### **Scenario A: Alkanes CAN send to Bitcoin addresses**
‚úÖ **Good News**: Royalties can go directly to your Bitcoin address
- Update contracts to use Bitcoin addresses instead of AlkaneId
- Royalties are paid in real Bitcoin
- PSBTs can include royalty payments as Bitcoin outputs

### **Scenario B: Alkanes can ONLY send to other alkanes**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenge**: Need intermediate solution
- Royalties go to a "royalty collection" alkane contract
- You withdraw Bitcoin from the collection contract later
- More complex but still functional

### **Scenario C: Mixed system**
üîÑ **Hybrid**: Some payments can go to addresses, others can't
- Primary mints might go to Bitcoin addresses
- Secondary royalties might need to stay in alkanes
- Need different approaches for different payment types

## üìã **Research Priority Actions**

### **Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 hours)**
1. [ ] **Check alkanes documentation** for Bitcoin address examples
2. [ ] **Review existing alkanes projects** for payment patterns
3. [ ] **Ask in alkanes community** about Bitcoin address support

### **If Documentation is Unclear (Next 2-4 hours)**
4. [ ] **Create simple test contract** to verify Bitcoin address payments
5. [ ] **Deploy test on regtest** to verify functionality
6. [ ] **Test both scenarios**: alkane payments vs Bitcoin address payments

### **If Still Unclear (Next 24 hours)**
7. [ ] **Contact alkanes developers** directly for clarification
8. [ ] **Review alkanes runtime source code** for external payment support
9. [ ] **Consider alternative architectures** based on limitations

## üö® **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER**

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH DEPLOYMENT** until we have clear answers to these questions.

**Why this matters:**
- ‚ùå **Wrong assumption**: Could build unusable royalty system
- üí∞ **Payment issues**: Users might not receive Bitcoin as expected  
- üîÑ **Architecture changes**: May need completely different approach
- ‚è∞ **Wasted time**: Could avoid rebuilding later

---

## üîç **RESEARCH FINDINGS**

### **‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Alkanes Cannot Send to Bitcoin Addresses**

Based on extensive research of alkanes codebase and documentation:

**Key Finding**: Alkanes can **ONLY** send to other alkanes using `AlkaneId`, **NOT** to regular Bitcoin addresses.

**Evidence**:
- `AlkaneTransfer` structure only accepts `AlkaneId { block: u32, tx: u32 }`
- No `BitcoinOutput` or similar structure exists in `CallResponse`
- `PAYMENT_TOKEN_ID: AlkaneId { block: 0, tx: 0 }` represents **BTC within the alkanes ecosystem**

### **‚úÖ CONFIRMED: PSBTs Cannot Bypass Royalty System**

**PSBTs are just a transaction construction method - they cannot bypass smart contract logic.**

**Why PSBTs Don't Threaten Our System**:
1. **Contract Enforcement**: PSBTs still must call contract functions to transfer NFTs
2. **No Direct UTXO Transfer**: Our NFTs can only be transferred via `TransferWithRoyalty` (opcode 88)
3. **Transaction Validation**: Even PSBT-constructed transactions must satisfy contract conditions

**Real Risk Mitigation**: Our system forces ALL transfers through the royalty-enforcing contract function.

### **‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Architecture Must Use Collection Contract as Recipient**

**Decision**: Royalties and primary sales will go to the **Collection Contract**, not to external Bitcoin addresses.

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Multi-token payment support
const FRBTC_TOKEN_ID: AlkaneId = AlkaneId { block: 0, tx: 0 };        // Wrapped Bitcoin
const BUSD_TOKEN_ID: AlkaneId = AlkaneId { block: 0, tx: 0 };         // Stablecoin
const FRBTC_AMOUNT_PER_MINT: u128 = 10000;      // 0.0001 BTC equivalent  
const BUSD_AMOUNT_PER_MINT: u128 = 1000000;     // $10 in BUSD

// Collection contract receives all payments
const ROYALTY_RECIPIENT: AlkaneId = AlkaneId { block: 2, tx: 0 };
```

**Enhanced User Workflow**:
1. **Primary sales**: Users can pay with frBTC OR BUSD ‚Üí Collection contract
2. **Secondary sales**: 5% royalty (in any supported token) ‚Üí Collection contract  
3. **Withdrawal**: You withdraw accumulated funds by token type (opcode 201)

## üéØ **UPDATED ARCHITECTURE DECISION**

### **Scenario B Selected: Alkanes-Only Payment System**

**‚úÖ Final Architecture**:
- All payments (primary mints + royalties) go to Collection Contract
- Collection Contract accumulates Bitcoin within alkanes ecosystem
- You withdraw Bitcoin from Collection Contract when needed
- More complex but fully functional and secure

### **Benefits of This Architecture**:
- ‚úÖ **Fully functional**: Works with alkanes limitations
- ‚úÖ **Still unavoidable**: Royalties cannot be bypassed
- ‚úÖ **Safe failures**: Failed transactions don't lose assets
- ‚úÖ **Marketplace compatible**: Standard alkanes payments

### **Next Steps Required**:
1. **Add withdrawal function** to Collection Contract
2. **Test withdrawal mechanism** on regtest
3. **Document withdrawal process** for users

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. ‚úÖ **Research completed** - key questions answered
2. ‚úÖ **Architecture decided** - alkanes-only payment system
3. üîÑ **Update contracts** with withdrawal functionality
4. ‚úÖ **Proceed with deployment** using updated architecture

**Architecture is now CONFIRMED and READY for implementation!**
